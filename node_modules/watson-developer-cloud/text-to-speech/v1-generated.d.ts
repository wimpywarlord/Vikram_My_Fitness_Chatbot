/**
 * ### Service Overview The IBM Text to Speech service provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) that uses IBM's speech-synthesis capabilities to synthesize text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages, dialects, and voices. The service currently synthesizes text from US English, UK English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, or Brazilian Portuguese into audio spoken in a male or female voice (the service supports only a single gender for some languages). The audio is streamed back to the client with minimal delay. ### API Overview The Text to Speech service consists of the following related endpoints: * `/v1/voices` provides information about the voices available for synthesized speech. * `/v1/synthesize` synthesizes written text to audio speech. * `/v1/pronunciation` returns the pronunciation for a specified word. The `/v1/pronunciation` method is currently beta functionality. * `/v1/customizations` and `/v1/customizations/{customization_id}` lets users create custom voice models, which are dictionaries of words and their translations for use in speech synthesis. All `/v1/customizations` methods are currently beta functionality. * `/v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words` and `/v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words/{word}` lets users manage the words in a custom voice model.    **Note about the Try It Out feature:** The `Try it out!` button lets you experiment with the methods of the API by making actual cURL calls to the service. The feature is **not** supported for use with the `POST /v1/synthesize` method. For examples of calls to this method, see the [Text to Speech API reference](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/text-to-speech/api/v1/). ### API Usage The following information provides details about using the service to synthesize audio: * **Audio formats:** The service supports a number of audio formats (MIME types). For more information about audio formats and sampling rates, including links to a number of Internet sites that provide technical and usage details about the different formats, see [Specifying an audio format](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/http.html#format). * **SSML:** Many methods refer to the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), an XML-based markup language that provides annotations of text for speech-synthesis applications; for example, many methods accept or produce translations that use an SSML-based phoneme format. See [Using SSML](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/SSML.html) and [Using IBM SPR](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/SPRs.html). * **Word translations:** Many customization methods accept or return sounds-like or phonetic translations for words. A phonetic translation is based on the SSML format for representing the phonetic string of a word. Phonetic translations can use standard International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation:   &lt;phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"t&#601;m&#712;&#593;to\"&gt;&lt;/phoneme&gt;   or the proprietary IBM Symbolic Phonetic Representation (SPR):   &lt;phoneme alphabet=\"ibm\" ph=\"1gAstroEntxrYFXs\"&gt;&lt;/phoneme&gt;   For more information about customization and about sounds-like and phonetic translations, see [Understanding customization](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/custom-intro.html). * **GUIDs:** The pronunciation and customization methods accept or return a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). For example, customization IDs (specified with the `customization_id` parameter) and service credentials are GUIDs. GUIDs are hexadecimal strings that have the format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. * **WebSocket interface:** The service also offers a WebSocket interface as an alternative to its HTTP REST interface for speech synthesis. The WebSocket interface supports both plain text and SSML input, including the SSML &lt;mark&gt; element and word timings. See [The WebSocket interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/websockets.html). * **Authentication:** You authenticate to the service by using your service credentials. You can use your credentials to authenticate via a proxy server that resides in IBM Cloud, or you can use your credentials to obtain a token and contact the service directly. See [Service credentials for Watson services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-credentials.html) and [Tokens for authentication](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-tokens.html). * **Custom voice model ownership:** In all cases, you must use service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns a custom voice model to use the methods described in this documentation with that model. For more information, see [Ownership of custom voice models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/custom-models.html#customOwner). * **Request Logging:** By default, all Watson services log requests and their results. Data is collected only to improve the Watson services. If you do not want to share your data, set the header parameter `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` to `true` for each request. Data is collected for any request that omits this header. See [Controlling request logging for Watson services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-logging.html).   The service does not log data (words and translations) that are used to build custom language models; your training data is never used to improve the service's base models. The service does log data when a custom model is used with a synthesize request; you must set the `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` request header to prevent logging for recognition requests. For more information, see [Request logging and data privacy](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/custom-models.html#customLogging).  For more information about the service and its various interfaces, see [About Text to Speech](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/text-to-speech/index.html).
